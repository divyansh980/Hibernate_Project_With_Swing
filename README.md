# Movie Management System

## Overview

The Movie Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage movie records. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie data using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing. The application utilizes Hibernate for ORM and MySQL as the database.

## Features

- Add new movies to the database.
- Fetch and display movie details by ID.
- Update existing movie records.
- Delete movies from the database.
- View a list of all movies in a tabbed interface.
- User-friendly GUI with multiple panels for better organization.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for the application.
- **Swing**: For building the GUI.
- **Hibernate**: For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
- **MySQL**: As the database for storing movie records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Server
- Maven (for dependency management)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MoviesManagementSystem.git
   cd MoviesManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Database Setup:**

   - Create a MySQL database named `moviesdb`.
   - Ensure you have a table named `movies` with the appropriate schema.

3. **Configure Hibernate:**

   - Ensure you have a `persistence.xml` file in the `src/main/resources/META-INF` directory to configure Hibernate.

4. **Build the Project:**

   If you are using Maven, run:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. **Run the Application:**

   You can run the `MainFrame` class to launch the application:

   ```bash
   java -cp target/classes com.movies.app.MainFrame
   ```

## Usage

- Open the application and navigate through the tabs to manage movies.
- Use the "Add Movie" tab to input new movie details.
- Use the "Movie List" tab to view all movies and refresh the list as needed.
